# Design Identity — Engineering Portfolio (V2)

## Purpose
This portfolio must communicate:
- Software Engineering maturity
- Quality-first mindset (testing, reliability, contracts)
- Product thinking (clarity, narrative, intentional scope)
- Calm confidence (no flashy effects, no “influencer” tone)

If someone lands here, they should understand who I am in < 30 seconds.

## Visual Personality
**Archetype:** Engineer with Quality focus + Entrepreneurial mindset  
**Tone:** Calm, precise, intentional, trustworthy  
**Avoid:** over-design, gimmicky animations, “startup landing page hype”, generic dark-mode aesthetic

---

## Color Palette (from personal brand photo)
- **wine:** `#4E1F28` — authority, emphasis, links, key headings
- **wineMuted:** `#66323B` — hover states, subtle accents
- **beige:** `#F3EFE8` — main background (reading comfort)
- **surface:** `#ECE7DF` — cards, sections, containers

### Usage Rules
- Background: **beige** (default)
- Surfaces/cards: **surface**
- Primary actions/links: **wine**
- Secondary states/hover/borders: **wineMuted**
- Contrast must remain readable and calm (no neon, no harsh blacks)

---

## Typography
**Goal:** readability + “technical writing” vibe

Recommended pairing:
- Headings: `Playfair Display` (or `Libre Baskerville`)
- Body/UI: `Inter` (or `Source Sans 3`)

### Rules
- Max 2 font families
- Prioritize readability over personality
- Keep body text comfortable for long-form reading

---

## Layout Principles
- Plenty of whitespace
- Clear hierarchy (H1/H2/H3 consistent)
- Grid-based layout
- Cards for projects and writing
- Minimal shadows (prefer borders / soft depth)
- Motion: subtle (150–200ms), never distracting

---

## Content Principles
- Clarity > cleverness
- Concrete details > buzzwords
- Honest status (“in progress” is fine)
- Explain tradeoffs briefly (engineering decisions)

### What must be obvious
- Who I am (role + focus)
- What I build (projects)
- How I think (writing + decisions)
- How to reach me (contact)

---

## Sections (Information Architecture)
1. Home (identity + primary CTA to Projects)
2. About (short, professional)
3. Projects (FocusFlow highlighted)
4. Writing / Notes (technical writing)
5. Timeline (career evolution)
6. Contact

---

## Quality / Testing Identity (without looking like “QA only”)
This portfolio should show:
- testability as a design principle
- contracts and reliability
- CI/CD as part of engineering discipline

Preferred phrasing:
- “Quality-first engineering”
- “Systems designed to be tested”
- “Reliability and maintainability”

Avoid:
- “I just test things”
- “QA vibe”
- overly defensive language

---

## Anti-goals (Do NOT do)
- Too many gradients
- Too much animation
- Overly dark / cyber aesthetic
- “Hi I’m…” influencer tone
- Tech stack list with no narrative
- Big hero buttons without context
