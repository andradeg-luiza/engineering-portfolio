# Engineering Portfolio — Luiza Andrade

> Professional engineering portfolio focused on **software quality, systems thinking, and product-oriented development**.

This repository represents **Version 2** of my personal engineering portfolio.  
The first version remains online while this one is being rebuilt with deeper architectural intent, stronger testing practices, and clearer technical storytelling.

---

## Purpose

This project exists to demonstrate **how I think as an engineer**, not just what I build.

It emphasizes:

- Software quality and testing mindset (SDET-oriented)
- Clean architecture and maintainable systems
- Technical communication and documentation
- Continuous evolution through real-world engineering practices

---

## Philosophy

This portfolio is treated as a **real product**, not a static website.

That means:
- Incremental delivery
- Clear trade-offs
- Documented decisions
- Tests as first-class citizens
- CI/CD from the beginning

Progress is intentional, documented, and visible through commits and architectural decisions.

---

## Main Sections (Planned)

- **Home** — professional overview and engineering identity
- **Career Timeline** — technical and professional evolution
- **Projects**
  - FocusFlow (primary case study)
  - Future projects
- **Technical Writing** — design decisions, lessons learned
- **Contact**

---

## FocusFlow — Flagship Project

FocusFlow is a productivity platform used as a **living case study** throughout this portfolio.

It demonstrates:
- Backend architecture with NestJS and Prisma
- API testing and validation
- Integration and E2E testing strategies
- CI-friendly workflows
- Product thinking applied to engineering

A dedicated page will document:
- The problem being solved
- Technical stack
- Current status
- Short-term roadmap

---

## Tech Stack (Initial Direction)

This portfolio is being built as a **monorepo**, with clear separation of concerns.

Planned stack includes:

- **Frontend**: Modern React-based framework (TBD)
- **Backend APIs**: Node.js / NestJS
- **Testing**
  - Backend: PactumJS, Supertest
  - Frontend: Playwright
  - Unit tests where applicable
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Infrastructure**: Docker-first mindset

Exact choices are documented as they are made.

---

## Documentation

Supporting documents explain **design intent**, **architecture**, and **evolution**.

- [`/docs/design-identity.md`](docs/design-identity.md) — visual identity, tone, and UX intent

These documents evolve together with the codebase.

---

## Status

 **Work in progress**

This repository is actively developed.  
Incomplete sections are intentional and tracked.

---

## Notes for Reviewers

If you are reviewing this as a recruiter or engineer:

- Focus on **structure and intent**, not just features
- Code and documentation reflect real-world trade-offs
- Evolution is part of the design
